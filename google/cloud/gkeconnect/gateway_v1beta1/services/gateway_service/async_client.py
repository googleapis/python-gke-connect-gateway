                    }

                Use of this type only changes how the request and
                response bodies are handled, all other features will
                continue to work unchanged.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            google.api.httpbody_pb2.HttpBody:
                Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
                   payload formats that can't be represented as JSON,
                   such as raw binary or an HTML page.

                   This message can be used both in streaming and
                   non-streaming API methods in the request as well as
                   the response.

                   It can be used as a top-level request field, which is
                   convenient if one wants to extract parameters from
                   either the URL or HTTP template into the request
                   fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

                   Example:

                      message GetResourceRequest {
                         // A unique request id. string request_id = 1;

                         // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
                         google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

                      }

                      service ResourceService {
                         rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
                            returns (google.api.HttpBody);

                         rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
                            returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

                      }

                   Example with streaming methods:

                      service CaldavService {
                         rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                            returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

                         rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                            returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

                      }

                   Use of this type only changes how the request and
                   response bodies are handled, all other features will
